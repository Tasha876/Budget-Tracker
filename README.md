## 1. Description
A budget tracker that can also function offline and syncs seamlessly when online. It also has a cool graph that shows the amount of money you have left (or are in debt).

### Note:
I also added the ability for transactions to be deleted in case you made a mistake.

### Summary of Functionality

* You can either add or subtract funds by clicking of the correspoding buttons. Once the transaction is added, you may delete it by clicking on the trash can next to that transaction.
